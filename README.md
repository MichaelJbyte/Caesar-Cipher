# Caesar-Cipher
Python project to make a Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder. [10/22/25]

Today I will begin my very first python project, a Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder. I would like for this program to both encrypt and decrypt text using as Caesar cipher. This project will be based off my current knowledge and will not leverage any sort of tutorial. Help will be allowed from google for topics I may not currently know. Anything I may not understand will be properly learned and noted here, alongside the process of creating the cipher program. My aim for this project is to familarize myself with self learning and accomplish a, somewhat useful, beginner project.

## What is a Caesar Cipher?

Utilizing an [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/) from **_geeksforgeeks.org_**, I swiftly learned all about the caesar cipher. This article overviews its history, which I will not cover. However, I will note that a Caesar cipher is an encryption method which shifts plaintext over a specified amount alphabetically. The common shift is three letters, but it can range anywhere from zero to twenty-five.

For an example, you can use the cipher with a shift of three to change the name: **"JACOB"** to **"MDFRE."**

## Process

Below any noteworthy thoughts and processes will be listed when making the cipher program. Images of the code will be provided below as well:



## New Topics

Any syntax which I had not known of previously and was used to help me with this project will be below. I will attempt to learn these topics and not just copy or use them simply for this project:
